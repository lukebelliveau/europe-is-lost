# 00. ENTER THE RABBIT HOLE
first thing to know, when you see text (prededed with slashes) that looks like this:

`// this is a comment`

that is a comment, it is meant for us to speak english to each other. anything in front of backslashes will not be executed as code.

that is a comment. that means it is not code that will be executed, it is our way of leaving notes for each other

# 01. INTRO 
We will first produce a phrase - you will code it, and the computer will print it back to you. Traditionally, the first phrase is "Hello World". Tradition is fucking stupid, so print whatever you want. You will do so like this. Type this into your 01.js file:

`console.log("hello, world")`

to execute the program, type the following into your terminal:

`node 01_intro/01.js`

you should see whatever dumb message you decided to write back on your terminal. if you got lost along the way, please ask and you will find a helping hand. let's go down the rabbit hole <33
